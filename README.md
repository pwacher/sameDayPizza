65% hydration is a good starting point as the dough will be easier to handle. 70% will help in getting the crust a bit more airy, but the dough will start to get more sticky.

2. Mix in 10% of the flour. Mix until the the flour is decently incorporated into the salted water.
3. Add in the yeast. Stir until the yeast is melted into the mixture.
4. Slowly incorporate the rest of the flour, using a mixing spoon or hand to mix in the flour. Mix until the flour has been incorporated.
5. Empty the bowl onto the table and continue to knead and fold for 10-15 mins, until the dough comes together and is relatively smooth.
6. Add someolive olive oil to the top of the dough and leave it to rest for 15 mins.
